Three observable trends in the Heroes of Pymoli dataset

1) Males purchase and spend more money as a group than Females, however Females tend to spend slightly more on average regarding purchase price and average total purchase per person.  This is likely the result of there being more over five and a half times more Male players than Female players.  Although the average spending values for the Other/Non-Disclosed group is higher than the Male and Female groups, with only 15 purchases made from this category, there may not be sufficient data to determine its effects on revenue.


2)  At 44.79%, the majority of our players are between the ages of 20 to 24, with significant spill over from the 15-19 (18.58%) and 25-29 (13.37%) age groups.  With that in mind, it is safe to assume that our players are likely in the high school and college age demographics, with some spill over into the recent graduate and young professional age demographics.


3) In terms of purchases per age group, the 20-24 age demographic is the highest spending of our player base with 365 purchases made.  In total, the 20-24 age group spent $1,114.06, with average total purchase per person at $4.32 and an average purchase price at $3.05. The next highest is the 15-19 age group.  Although they spend just under half of the 20-24 age group, they have the potential to spend just as much or more than their older colleagues when they reach that age as our game continues to grow.



Side note: 
I almost neglected to use the groupby function, but at least I got a lot of practice with loc/iloc!  That's what happens when I start the assignment while a bit braindead.  Groupby made everything much easier and faster.
